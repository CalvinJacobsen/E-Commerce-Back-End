## Description 

 This is a program that uses seqeulize and MySQL2 to act as a backend for a e-commerce website, storing products, tags, and categories in a JSON based format. This application additionally allows us to perform GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests via InsomniaCore, giving us a maliable and efficient database.

## Installation Instructions 

 Download the files or clone the repo via Github and then run "$npm i" (this will download sequelize, express and MySQL2). Then, seed the database but running "npm run seed". After the DB has been seeded you can start the server by typing npm start, and the app will be listening on port 3001.
